					<h1>Advertising: Winefamily - Match Your Catch</h1>
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>
						Winefamily urgently needed to raise its brand awareness and came to me with a submission deadline (in 3 days time) for a print ad on the men's magazine, Esquire (Singapore).
					</p>
					<h2>Solution</h2>
					<p>
						I provided creative direction, including the key visual and tag line. The idea is based on a truism that medium-bodied wines pair well with fish.
					</p>
					<h2>1. Ideation Phase</h2>
					<p>
						I discussed with the business owner what might Winefamily's strengths be in the local scene, and sketched a mind map to generate ideas for the tagline and key visual. I began the exercise by listing truisms around wines such as:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>White wines go well with light-intensity meats like fish and chicken</li>
						<li>Red wines are best served a few degrees below room temperature</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>2.  Design phase</h2>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/wine2.png" alt="" /></span>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/wine3.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>
						I provided two final ideas:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Tagline: "Match the catch". Key visual: A bottle of white wine used as fishing bait, surrounded by curious trouts.</li>
						<li>Tagline: "Trouts know their wines. Do you?". Key visual: A trout having swallowed a wine bottle.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This was a fairly quick process due to the time constraint. Client was pleased with both of the options but felt that, for option 2, it was not obvious that it was a wine bottle. We arrived at the following:
					</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/wine4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
